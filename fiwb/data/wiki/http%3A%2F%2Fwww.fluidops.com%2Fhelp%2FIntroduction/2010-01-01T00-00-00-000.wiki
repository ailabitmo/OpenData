== What is the Information Workbench ==

The Information Workbench is a platform for Linked Data applications that allows to
* Semantically integrate and interlink data scattered among different systems, to provide a unified view on isolated data silos
* Cross the chasm between enterprise-internal and public data, thus making public knowledge available internally
* Leverage semantic technologies for improved search, presentation, and collaborative augmentation of data
* Explore global Linked Open Data registries and integrate relevant data sets on demand
* Rapidly build innovative Linked Data applications using W3C standards like RDF and SPARQL

Linked data formats exhibit a high degree of interoperability and ease of reuse, making them ideal for publishing data, on the web, as Linked Open Data.  The same principles are becoming increasingly popular in enterprise, with internal data being represented as Linked Enterprise Data.  The Information Workbench allows one to harness the power of Linked Open (and Enterprise) Data, allowing for the development of linked data applications, that help to visualize, analyze and query data.
