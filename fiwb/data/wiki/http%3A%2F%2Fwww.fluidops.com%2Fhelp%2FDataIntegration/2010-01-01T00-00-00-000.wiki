= Data Integration and Management =
As a platform for application development on top of Linked Data, the Information Workbench provides a variety of features for importing and exporting data. This includes both support for the integration of data that is already present in Linked Data formats (such as RDF and OWL) as well as the integration of data from non Linked Data formats and systems, including relational databases, XML, and legacy systems. The links listed in the table below provide the required entry points for all data management related topics.
