There are several fields that must be filled in including the usual Identifier and Poll Interval fields, these can be filled in with any valid identifier (url) and integer respectively.

The two important fields that must be filled in are 'host' and 'root'.  The value for 'host' must be the URL of the LDAP server that you want the information to be extracted from for example if your host is called "myHost" the value of server should be "ldap://myHost". 'root' is the root node under which the provider will search and extract information from.

Optionally, if your LDAP server listens on a custom port (other than the default) this can be defined in 'port', the default value for this is 389.
