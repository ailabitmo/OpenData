=== Constraint Validation ===

The constraint validation page gives you an overview of all triples that do not conform to the ontology stored in the repository. Note that this feature is experimental only.

To give a concrete example, assume that our repository contains exactly the following triples:

<source>
:Adam :knows :Eve.
:knows rdfs:domain :Human.
:knows rdfs:range :Human.
</source>

The ontology implies that both :Adam and :Eve are of rdf:type :Human. However, this is not materialized in the data. Therefore, our constraint validation page would list the triple :Adam :knows :Eve.

As the constraint validation page scans the whole repository for non-conforming triples, the page may take a while to load.
