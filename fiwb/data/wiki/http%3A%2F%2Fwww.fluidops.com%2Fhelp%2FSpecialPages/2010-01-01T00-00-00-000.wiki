== Special Pages ==

In the Information Workbench special pages serve purposes that do not fit in any other administrative page like e.g. getting an overview of all broken widgets in the system.

Currently, we have separate help pages for the following special pages:

* [[Help:Constraints|Constraint Validation]]
* [[Help:WikiDiagnostics|Wiki Diagnostics]]
