=== Wiki Diagnostics ===

The wiki diagnostics page lists wiki pages which contain broken widgets or dead links.  Note that this feature is experimental only.

The information listed on this page can be helpful if you want to make sure that your pages contain only up-to-date links. Furthermore, the type of a page is shown (if the page was created by a user or was bootstrapped) and the number of revisions.

As the wiki diagnostics page scans all wiki pages, it may take a while to load.
