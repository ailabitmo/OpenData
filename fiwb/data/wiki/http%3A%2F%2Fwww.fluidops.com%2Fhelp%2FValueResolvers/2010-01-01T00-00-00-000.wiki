=== Value Resolvers ===
There is also a mechanism to post-format the values that are displayed by template variables by the use of predefined functions (read more about template variables and predefined functions in [[Help:Wiki | Help:Wiki]]). For instance, one may want to transform a numeric value to a currency (e.g. "5" to "5в‚¬" or "$5"), render an extracted value that links to a URL as an external URL, embed a picture if the extracted value refers to a picture, etc. In oder to support such tasks, the IWB defines a set of so-called Value Resolvers. These are specified in brackets after the template variable expression. To give an example, the template expression

<pre>$ this.myImage[THUMBNAIL] $</pre>

renders the result of property ''myImage'' as a an image thumbnail (assuming that it points to a valid URL displaying an image). The following value resolvers are defined:
